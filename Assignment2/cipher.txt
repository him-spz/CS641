    CLUE:
            As you move closer to the boulder, you realize that it has
            something written on it!

            Wiping the dust from the boulder with your hand - and getting
            your hand very dirty in the process - you see strange symbols
            on the boulder -- it appears like some code:



                ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--



            The spirit of Cave Man is the keeper of the chamber. 
            To navigate through the chamber, you must pay respect 
            to him first. When you bow down, you hear a faint voice-
            "You have been blessed, my child. Keep in mind that 
            you must always believe in yourself and PLAY FAIR".
